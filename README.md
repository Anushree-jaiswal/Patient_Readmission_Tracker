# Patient_Readmission_Tracker 

## Project Overview-  
This project aims to develop a **patient readmission tracking and analysis system** to help hospitals **monitor patient records, predict readmission rates, and optimize resource allocation**. By analyzing patient data, we can identify high-risk patients and recommend interventions to reduce hospital readmissions.  

---

## Features-  
- **Patient Record Management**: Store and manage patient details securely.  
- **Readmission Prediction**: Predict the likelihood of a patient’s readmission using machine learning.  
- **Resource Allocation**: Help hospitals allocate beds, staff, and medical resources effectively.  
- **Data Visualization**: Generate insights through graphical reports and dashboards.  
- **Database Integration**: Store patient data efficiently using a robust database system.

## Problem Statement-  
Hospital readmissions are a significant burden on healthcare systems, leading to increased costs and reduced efficiency. The lack of a proper **tracking mechanism** makes it difficult for hospitals to:  
1. **Monitor patient records** systematically.  
2. **Identify high-risk patients** who are likely to be readmitted.  
3. **Optimize hospital resources** like beds, staff, and medication.  

This project provides a **data-driven approach** to **predict and analyze readmission rates**, allowing hospitals to improve patient care and reduce unnecessary readmissions.
