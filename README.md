# Patient_Readmission_Tracker 

## Project Overview 
This project aims to develop a **patient readmission tracking and analysis system** to help hospitals **monitor patient records, predict readmission rates, and optimize resource allocation**. By analyzing patient data, we can identify high-risk patients and recommend interventions to reduce hospital readmissions.

## Features
- **Patient Record Management**: Store and manage patient details securely.  
- **Readmission Prediction**: Predict the likelihood of a patient‚Äôs readmission using machine learning.  
- **Resource Allocation**: Help hospitals allocate beds, staff, and medical resources effectively.  
- **Data Visualization**: Generate insights through graphical reports and dashboards.  
- **Database Integration**: Store patient data efficiently using a robust database system.

## Problem Statement  
Hospital readmissions are a significant burden on healthcare systems, leading to increased costs and reduced efficiency. The lack of a proper **tracking mechanism** makes it difficult for hospitals to:  
1. **Monitor patient records** systematically.  
2. **Identify high-risk patients** who are likely to be readmitted.  
3. **Optimize hospital resources** like beds, staff, and medication.  

This project provides a **data-driven approach** to **predict and analyze readmission rates**, allowing hospitals to improve patient care and reduce unnecessary readmissions.

## üìå Requirements Gathering and Planning  
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Understanding the Problem Statement**  
- Analyze the impact of hospital readmissions on costs and resource allocation.  
- Identify key factors contributing to patient readmissions.  
- Define project objectives: reducing readmission rates through predictive analytics.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Defining Project Scope**  
- **In-Scope:**  
  - Patient data analysis (e.g., demographics, medical history, previous admissions).  
  - Machine learning model to predict readmission risk.  
  - Data visualization for insights and trends.  
  - Resource optimization recommendations.  
- **Out of Scope:**  
  - Real-time hospital management system.  
  - Direct integration with electronic health records (EHR).  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Gathering Data Requirements**  
- Identify datasets required (e.g., hospital records, patient history, diagnosis codes).  
- Ensure data privacy and compliance with regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR).  
- Determine necessary preprocessing steps (handling missing data, normalization).  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Technology Stack Selection**  
- **Programming Languages:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)  
- **Database:** SQL (for patient records storage and retrieval)  
- **Visualization Tools:** Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Machine Learning Models:** Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest  
- **Deployment:** Flask/Django (Optional for API), Streamlit (for UI)  

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Defining Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**  
- Readmission prediction accuracy (e.g., precision, recall, F1-score).  
- Reduction in readmission rates after model implementation.  
- Computation time and resource efficiency.  

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Project Timeline & Milestones**  
- **Week 1-2:** Data collection and preprocessing.  
- **Week 3-4:** Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature selection.  
- **Week 5-6:** Model development, training, and evaluation.  
- **Week 7-8:** Optimization, visualization, and documentation.  

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ **Risk Assessment and Mitigation**  
- **Data Quality Issues:** Missing values, outliers ‚Üí Use imputation techniques.  
- **Overfitting of ML Models:** Implement cross-validation and feature engineering.  
- **Compliance & Privacy Risks:** Ensure anonymization and adhere to regulations.

## üîÑ Data Preprocessing  
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Collection**  
- Gather patient records from hospital databases, public healthcare datasets, or simulated data.  
- Key features include:  
  - **Demographics:** Age, gender, ethnicity  
  - **Medical history:** Diagnoses, comorbidities, previous admissions  
  - **Treatment details:** Medications, procedures, length of stay  
  - **Hospital records:** Bed occupancy, discharge details, admission reasons  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Handling Missing Data**  
- Identify missing values using `df.isnull().sum()`.  
- Strategies for missing data:  
  - **Numerical features:** Impute using mean/median/mode.  
  - **Categorical features:** Use mode or create an "Unknown" category.  
  - **Drop rows/columns:** If missing data exceeds a threshold (e.g., 30%).  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Cleaning**  
- Remove duplicate records.  
- Standardize column names for consistency.  
- Convert inconsistent data formats (e.g., date formats, categorical encoding).  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Feature Engineering**  
- **Creating new features:**  
  - Calculate **readmission gap** (days between last discharge and readmission).  
  - Generate **risk score** based on past hospitalizations.  
- **Encoding categorical variables:**  
  - One-hot encoding for non-ordinal categories (e.g., gender, admission type).  
  - Label encoding for ordinal categories (e.g., severity levels).  
- **Scaling numerical data:**  
  - Apply Min-Max Scaling or Standardization (Z-score normalization).  

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Handling Outliers**  
- Use box plots and IQR method to detect extreme values.  
- Cap/floor extreme values or apply transformations (e.g., log transformation).  

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Splitting Data for Training and Testing**  
- Split dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets using:  
  ```python
  from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
  X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
  ```
  
### 7Ô∏è‚É£ **Balancing the Dataset (If Needed)**  
- Check for class imbalance in readmission labels (`df['readmitted'].value_counts()`).  
- If imbalanced:  
  - Use **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)**.  
  - Apply **undersampling** or **oversampling** methods.  

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ **Saving the Preprocessed Data**  
- Store the cleaned and processed dataset as a `.csv` file for reproducibility.  
- Example:  
  ```python
  df.to_csv("preprocessed_data.csv", index=False)
  ```
